# Digital Scholarship Projects

## East Asia Online

Contact: Yu Zhang, Assistant Professor of Chinese in the Department of Modern Langagues

This project contains online resources in East Asian studies, particularly in the following topics:

* Chinese literature
* Missionary works
* Maoist China
* Shanghai studies
* Teaching Chinese language and East Asia

This project aims at consolidating and categorizing useful information for scholars, teachers, and students of East Asian studies. Different from a conventional webpage provided by a library, this project not only lists e-text/image resources according to disciplines, but also includes research guides, tool-building projects, online publishing sites/forums, scholarship/fellowship information, etc.

## Veneration & Refinement

Contact: Graham McAleer, Professor of Philosophy

Veneration & Refinement, the name of the monograph found at [http://www.ethicsoffashion.com/](http://www.ethicsoffashion.com/), is a philosophical inquiry into the moral and aesthetic values that surround fashion, and in particular how the business of fashion touches upon matters of justice and religion.

The book is an argument between philosophers who think positively about fashion – David Hume and Adam Smith – and their critics, who range from anarchists to theologians, and even popes.

I hope intellectuals, the fashionable, and managers active in the trade of fashion will find lots to think about here but also models for how business in fashion can operate justly. The book takes fashion seriously as a tremendous venture in ideas but also aims to be practical, offering a series of moral issues faced by the business of fashion and a range of values and practices that can develop adequate responses.

The monograph touches upon a lot of topics but there are all sorts of issues I do not discuss: hence, the blog.  The book chapters do not change but every few days as I come across new and morally interesting developments in the fashion industry I make a blog post at [http://www.ethicsoffashion.com/blog/](http://www.ethicsoffashion.com/blog/).

## FIOLA

Contact: Leslie Zarker Morgan, Department of Modern Languages

The Franco-Italian On-Line Archive (FIOLA) [http://www.loyolanotredamelib.org/fiola/](http://www.loyolanotredamelib.org/fiola/) is a database of texts written in mixed French and Italian language from its earliest examples in the twelfth century to the Renaissance. These texts have a fascinating history and tradition, but because of the difficulty of the language, the inaccessibility of editions and the uniqueness of each literary artifact, they remain relatively unknown in non-specialist circles. It is our hope that this archive will help promote the study and appreciation of these beautiful and interesting texts by making lexical research easily accessible.
FIOLA currently presents: La Guerra di Attila and L'Entrée d'Espagne (and its Suite, commonly known as La Prise de Pamplune), Marco Polo's Milione and the Geste Francor. These texts are entirely searchable by word and morphological patterns. With the cooperation of other scholars in the field we hope to gather and make searchable the entire corpus of Franco-Italian texts in context. FIOLA would like to become a place where the community of scholars meets to consider these traditions. Participants: Leslie Zarker Morgan and David P. Bénéteau (Seton Hall University)

## Huon d'Auvergne Archive

Contact: Leslie Zarker Morgan, Department of Modern Languages

The Huon d'Auvergne Archive [http://www.huondauvergne.org/](http://www.huondauvergne.org/) is a digital edition. It is an international, inter-institutional, interdisciplinary project that presents the Franco-Italian Huon d'Auvergne romance-epic to a general audience for the first time. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the project aims to reach a diverse audience of both students and researchers. The modern English translation will make the text available widely, while the collaborative edition will allow epic scholars to read and research all four surviving textual witnesses of the Franco-Italian Huon d'Auvergne romance-epic. The digital tools presented in this site will eventually facilitate access to high-resolution images of the manuscripts. It is our hope that the textual resources presented on our site will be used to further both research and teaching in epic studies.

## Berta e Milone, Orlandino (translations from the Franco-Italian Geste Francor)

Contact: Leslie Zarker Morgan, Department of Modern Languages

[https://www.arlima.net/the-orb/encyclop/culture/lit/italian/morganintro.html]([https://www.arlima.net/the-orb/encyclop/culture/lit/italian/morganintro.html])
This translation into English of two unique sections of romance epic from the first half of the fourteenth century demonstrates the relation of northern Italian texts with French chansons de geste. It is meant to introduce students and colleagues to a lesser-known phenomenon in the development of vernacular literature in the Italian peninsula that leads to such works as Ariosto's Orlando Furioso (Mad Roland) in the sixteenth century. Because of the difficulty of the language in which it is written, this translation serves not only English-speakers but also Italian and French speakers.

## The Scholastic Commentaries and Texts Archive (SCTA)

Contact: Jeffrey C. Witt, Department of Philosophy

The [SCTA](http://scta.info) is a community and a webservice. The aim of this project is to connect and freely distribute the intellectual history of the medieval past. Through establishing community standards and API, the project aims to collect and organize the scholastic corpus as data first: data that can be freely re-used for a plurality of research purposes through the world. An number of separate applications already make use of this data (see for example [http://scta.lombardpress.org](http://scta.lombardpress.org)), and the SCTA works with a number of institutions to make this data re-usable within their collections. Such institutions include Harvard University, St. Louis University, E-Codices the Virtual Library of Switzerland, the National Library of France, and many others. 

In short the project aims to create the required infrastructure to resist the fragmenting tendencies of the traditional publication workflow and to show scholars that there is another way: one that makes textual data freely available for use and re-use, that encourages collaboration instead of competition, and fights redundancy at all costs.

Below are number of related projects that use data served from the SCTA

### [The LombardPress Publication Project](http://lombardpress.org)
LombardPress is publication system that aims to build and support applications that specialize in publicizing data made available through the SCTA. More information and project blog can be found here [http://lombardpress.org](http://lombardpress.org)

###. [The SCTA Reading Room](http://scta.lombardpress.org)
The SCTA reading room is an implementation of the LombardPress-Web Application. It uses the LombardPress-Web application to allow users to freely read, annotate, and study the scholastic corpus.

###	[The SCTA Image Viewer](http://mirador.scta.info)
A IIIF compliant site that brings together SCTA data with images of manuscripts containing scholastic texts from throughout the world

###	[LombardPress-Print](http://print.lombardpress.org)
This site is an implementation of the Lbp-Print-Web-App co-created with Michael Stenskjær Christensen of the University of Copenhagen. This site is a place that users can freely generate on-demand PDF of any text or text fragment within the scholastic corpus. It is also a web service that allows other applications to make PDFs available to their users.

### [The Scholastic Quotation Explorer Application](http://scta-quotations.herokuapp.com/)
This application is designed to allow researchers to explore the more than 60,000 quotations currently catalogued, organized, and made available through the SCTA.

### [TEI Web Editor](https://tei-web-editor.herokuapp.com/)
A web editor designed to allow users to edit texts in TEI and easily save those transcriptions directly to github.
